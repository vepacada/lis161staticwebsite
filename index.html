            <p>My name is Vikka Crystal Janela Erguiza Pacada. Most people call me Vikka, Viks, V, or CJ. I am currently a student of Bachelor of Library and Information Science at the University of the Philippines Diliman. People close to me describe me as humorous, timid, observant, and caring.<br>I like listening to music, reading books, playing my guitar, writing lyrics or poems, and most of all, taking pictures of different things that catch my eyes.</p>
           	<p>I've been into photography ever since I was young. I guess it started when my mom bought me a camera when I was 7 or 8. She bought one of those cameras with films that you had to get developed to see what the photos you took. Then my mom bought me a digital camera when I was 10. When I was around 12, she bought a Canon EOS1100D for our family but I was the one who ended up using it the most</p>
            <p>Now, I use phone more than the SLR because it's easier to bring. I use the SLR mostly when I travel, when there are special occasions, or if I see an eye-catching view and I have it with me. I am also the family's "designated photographer" when we have occasions like family outings.</p>
